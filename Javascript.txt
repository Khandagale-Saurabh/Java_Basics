1] callback=>function is passed inside another function
2]promise=>syntax simplified krta hai
3]async function hota hai [keyword hai] it is compulsory used with await

/*
let is block level scope
var is global level scope

Hoisting of var
Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top
of their scope before code execution. This means that if we do this:

[

        console.log (greeter);
        var greeter = "say hello"

                                     it is interpreted as this:

        var greeter;
        console.log(greeter); // greeter is undefined
        greeter = "say hello"

]

/*

1.When function is passes as argument to another function is called a CALLBACK FUNCTION
2.callback can be of two type 
i.e 
synchronous : it wait for opeation to complete after that it is excecute the next opeation.
asynchronous :it never wait for

[Closer is use for data hiding:inner function alwas have acess ti outter function variable]

//Sync example: one wait for two to complete and finish execution
function  two() 
{
 console.log('inside two()');    
}
function one(x)
{
 console.log('inside one()');    

    x()
    console.log('end');

}

one(two)

//asynch
setTimeout(()=>console.log('Inside Timer || Async'),2000);
console.log('I will still execute because,I will not follow sequence,I will not wait for someone elese operations to be completed');


// Problem without callback
